# 🌍 Predicting CO₂ Emissions Using Machine Learning: A Step Toward Climate Action (SDG 13)

### ✳️ Introduction

Climate change remains one of the most pressing challenges of our time, affecting every region of the world. Rising carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions contribute significantly to global warming, leading to severe weather patterns, biodiversity loss, and environmental instability. Achieving **Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action)** requires innovative tools to understand, forecast, and mitigate these emissions effectively.

In this project, I applied **machine learning** to predict CO₂ emissions based on economic and energy-related indicators. The aim is to provide policymakers and sustainability advocates with a data-driven approach to anticipate future emission trends and guide environmental planning.

---

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Many countries, especially developing nations, lack analytical systems to monitor and forecast carbon emissions. Without accurate predictions, it becomes difficult to implement effective climate policies or track progress toward global climate goals such as the **Paris Agreement**.

This project addresses this gap by building a predictive model that estimates CO₂ emissions per capita using variables like energy consumption, GDP, renewable energy use, and urbanization rates.

### 💡 Machine Learning Approach

To tackle this problem, I used a **Supervised Learning** approach, focusing on **Regression** models. Two algorithms were implemented and compared:

1. **Linear Regression** — to establish a baseline prediction model.
2. **Random Forest Regressor** — to capture nonlinear relationships and improve accuracy.

#### 🧰 Tools and Libraries

* **Python** (Google Colab environment)
* **Pandas**, **NumPy** (for data manipulation)
* **Scikit-learn** (for model training and evaluation)
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualization)

#### 📊 Dataset

Data was obtained from the **World Bank Open Data** and included:

* CO₂ emissions per capita
* Energy use per capita
* GDP per capita
* Renewable energy consumption (%)
* Urban population (%)

The dataset covered multiple countries between 2000 and 2020.

### ⚙️ Model Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   Merged multiple datasets, handled missing values, and normalized numerical features.

2. **Training:**
   The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing. Both Linear Regression and Random Forest were trained to predict CO₂ emissions.

3. **Evaluation:**
   Models were evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**, and **R² Score**.

4. **Visualization:**

   * Scatter plot of actual vs. predicted emissions
   * Feature importance chart to understand key emission drivers

### 📈 Results

| Model             | MAE  | RMSE | R² Score |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Linear Regression | 0.64 | 0.89 | 0.72     |
| Random Forest     | 0.38 | 0.61 | 0.89     |

The **Random Forest model** performed best, achieving an R² of **0.89**, indicating strong predictive power.
Key predictors influencing CO₂ emissions were:

* **Energy consumption per capita**
* **GDP per capita**
* **Renewable energy usage**

These insights suggest that economic activity and energy use remain strong determinants of carbon emissions, but increasing renewable energy adoption can significantly reduce them.

### 🌱 Ethical and Social Reflection

* **Bias Awareness:**
  The dataset includes more reliable data from developed nations, which could bias predictions for developing countries.

* **Fairness and Equity:**
  Future improvements could incorporate regional weighting to ensure balanced representation and fairness.

* **Sustainability Impact:**
  Predictive models like this can support governments and NGOs in making **data-driven climate decisions**, guiding investments toward renewable energy and carbon reduction strategies.

---

### 🚀 Impact and Future Work

This project demonstrates how **AI and machine learning** can drive progress toward **sustainable climate action**.
By forecasting CO₂ emissions, policymakers can:

* Identify high-risk regions,
* Set realistic emission targets, and
* Monitor progress in real time.

In future versions, I plan to integrate **real-time data streams** (e.g., weather APIs) and deploy the model via a **Streamlit web app** to make it accessible for environmental analysts and decision-makers.

---

### 💬 Conclusion

This project illustrates that machine learning is not just about algorithms—it’s about building technology that matters.
By aligning AI with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we can make smarter, fairer, and more sustainable decisions for the planet we share.
